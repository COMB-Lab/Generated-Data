# Generated-Data

## Project 1: Physics-Guided Deep Generative Model for New Ligand Discovery

This project leverages a physics-aware variant of the MolGAN framework (PhyMolGAN) for discovering novel ligands. The model integrates structural data with or without physics-based descriptors derived from the **PDBbind** dataset.

### Dataset

The datasets are organized by PDBbind version and presence of With & Without physics-based features:

- **PDBbind v19**
  - With physics features: **samples**
  - Without physics features: **5 samples**

- **PDBbind v2020**
  - With physics features: **samples**
  - Without physics features: **samples**

Each sample includes structural, molecular, and optionally physics-guided descriptors used in training or evaluating the model.

### Each subdirectory contains:
  - Generated ligand files in `.sdf.gz` format for various force fields (`add`, `gna`, `pkt`, `uff`)
  - Source ligand and receptor structures (`src.sdf.gz`)
  - File naming follows the pattern:  
    `DEMO_pdbbindtest_<ID>_lig_gen_fit_<ff>.sdf.gz`

## Project 2: Multi-Objective-Loss-Function-For-Free-Energy-Calculations

This project introduces a multi-objective loss function in the Physics- guided Rule-based graph convolution network (PG-RGCN) model that simultaneously optimizes empirical error, structural similarity, and physical consistency by integrating molecular fingerprints with physics-based features in a unified GCN framework. We used host-guest systems as the dataset to carry out this research project.

### Dataset 

Consists of 2 datasets: 
 - For binding free energy (ŒîŒîùê∫) calculations - `Final_data_DDG.csv` - consists of 72 host-guest systems and 15 physics based features. [1]
 - For entropy caculations (TŒîS) calculations - `NMAEntropy_65.csv` - consists of 65 host-guest systems and their TŒîS values for host, guest and complex.

The pdb files are present in the folder - `Final_data_DDG_pdbs` - these files were generated by combining host and guest structures taken from the benchmarksets github repo [1] and curated into a single complex as shown in `Data_Collection_Host_Guest.ipynb` [2].
